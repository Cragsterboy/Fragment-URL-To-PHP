# Fragment-URL-To-PHP

An easy way to be able to pass fragment URLs into PHP.

I have seen around a few places people saying you are only able to parse a fragment URL in javascript, this is true. 
However this routine allows users to turn the fragement URL into a URL which can then be sent as a request to the server, which PHP is able to parse.
